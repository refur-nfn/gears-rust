# FileStorage

Universal file storage and management service for the Gears middleware.

## Overview

FileStorage provides upload, download, metadata management, access control, and sharing capabilities for all platform
gears and users. It replaces ad-hoc per-gear file handling with a centralized, tenant-aware storage service.

### Key Capabilities

- **File operations** — upload, download, delete, list with rich metadata
- **Pluggable backends** — S3, GCS, Azure Blob, NFS, FTP, SMB, WebDAV, local filesystem
- **Access control** — tenant-scoped ownership, GTS file type classification, Authorization Service integration
- **Sharing** — shareable links (public/tenant/hierarchy scopes), signed URLs, direct transfer URLs
- **Access interfaces** — REST API, S3-compatible API, WebDAV API
- **Policies** — file type restrictions, size limits, sharing model restrictions, storage quotas
- **Lifecycle** — file versioning, retention policies, multipart upload, conditional requests (ETags)
- **Audit** — write operation audit trail, optional read audit logging

## Implementation status

### P1 (foundation)

The **P1 control plane** is implemented and tested. Highlights:

- Two crates: `cf-gears-file-storage-sdk` (public API) + `cf-gears-file-storage` (gear lib + `sidecar` binary).
- Control-plane REST under `/api/file-storage/v1` (create/presign/bind, download-URL, metadata CRUD, list,
  versions, storages) — JSON only; content never transits the control plane.
- Immutable-blob + content-pointer model with optimistic-CAS bind, FileStorage-level versioning, tenant isolation,
  Authorization-Service per-type checks, conditional requests (ETag / `If-Match` / `If-None-Match`).
- Pluggable backends (trait + `local-fs` + `in-memory`); Ed25519 signed URLs (codec-equivalent to, but not literal,
  PASETO `v4.public` — see [ADR-0004](docs/ADR/0004-cpt-cf-file-storage-adr-signed-url-transport.md)'s
  Implementation note); SHA-256 + magic-byte content-type validation; HTTP `Range`. Data-plane **sidecar** binary
  verifies tokens and streams bytes, then calls a token-authenticated `finalize` callback back to the control plane
  (`pending → available`); binding a version as the file's live content (`content_id`) is always a separate,
  client-issued request (see [DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) §3.6 and
  [ADR-0003](docs/ADR/0003-cpt-cf-file-storage-adr-sidecar-data-plane.md)).

### P2 (this branch)

Built on top of P1, the following shipped:

- **Policy engine** — allowed-types / size / custom-metadata-limit policies, resolved at tenant and user scope
  (`GET`/`PUT /policy`, `GET /policy/effective`). See
  [docs/features/policy-engine.md](docs/features/policy-engine.md).
- **Retention rules + background cleanup sweep** — per-tenant retention rules (`/retention-rules`) plus a background
  process that prunes expired files and reconciles orphaned backend objects. See
  [docs/features/retention-cleanup.md](docs/features/retention-cleanup.md).
- **Idempotent create** — `POST /files` is safe to retry.
- **Audit outbox** — a transactional outbox recording write operations (create, finalize, bind, metadata update,
  delete, ownership transfer, backend migration, …) for downstream audit consumption. The write side is fully
  shipped and tested; **the drain/relay side is not implemented** — see
  [docs/features/audit-trail.md](docs/features/audit-trail.md) for the tracked gap.
- **Events outbox** — file lifecycle events (`file.content_updated`, `file.owner_transferred`, …) are written
  transactionally alongside the mutation. **Not yet drained** to the platform EventBroker — see Tier 4 item 4.1 in
  the P2 remediation plan (same undrained-relay gap as the audit outbox above).
- **Ownership transfer** — `POST /files/{id}/transfer`, atomic owner swap with audit + event + usage-delta reporting.
  Target-owner validation is **partial** — only the nil-UUID sentinel is rejected; see
  [docs/features/ownership-transfer.md](docs/features/ownership-transfer.md) for the tracked gap.
- **Backend migration** — `POST /files/{id}/migrate`, relocates a non-versioned file's content to a different backend
  with a verified, mode-aware content-hash check before committing. See
  [docs/features/backend-migration.md](docs/features/backend-migration.md).
- **Multipart upload** — server-authoritative parts plan, per-part signed URLs, and the sidecar's report-part
  callback are wired end-to-end. **Functional only against a `multipart_native` backend** (today: the non-durable
  in-memory backend, dev/test only) — the default `local-fs` backend does not declare `multipart_native`, so
  `POST /files/{id}/multipart` is rejected against the real default topology. See
  [docs/features/multipart-coordinator.md](docs/features/multipart-coordinator.md) for the tracked gap and current
  vs. intended `complete` contract.
- **Storage quota — consumer scaffolding only, not enforced.** `check_quota`/`check_quota_bytes` gate every
  storage-increasing operation (`create_file`, `presign_version`, multipart initiate) via the `QuotaClient` port
  (`src/infra/external_clients.rs`), and are designed to fail **closed** once a real client is wired (a client
  error is propagated and denies the request — see `tests/enforce_test.rs`). **But `gear.rs` always constructs both
  services with `quota_client: None`** (`TODO(P2)`, Tier 1 item 1.4), and `None` makes the check a no-op
  (`Ok(())`) — so **storage quota is not enforced in any deployment today**; the effective default is permissive /
  fail-**open**, the opposite of the fail-closed design intent. This is blocked on a Quota Enforcement SDK crate,
  which does not exist yet: `gears/system/quota-enforcement/` is docs-only (PRD/DESIGN/ADRs, no Rust crate).
  Contrast with usage reporting, which is further along — a `usage-collector-sdk` crate exists (P2 1.12), even
  though `usage_reporter` is also still wired as `None` pending its own integration work.

**Not yet implemented**: sharing (shareable links), WebDAV, quota enforcement wiring (Tier 1 item 1.4, see the P2
storage-quota status above), and the S3 backend (Tier 1 item 1.7) — all still declared in the PRD/DESIGN but absent
from the code as of this branch.
