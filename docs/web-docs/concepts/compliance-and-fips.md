Gears provides a security and compliance **baseline** so regulated products start from a defensible position. It is important to be precise about what the framework gives you versus what product and process certification still requires.

## FIPS 140-3-ready crypto

Builds can route TLS through a supported FIPS-capable crypto provider with the `fips` feature:

```sh
cargo build --features fips
```

This is available on Linux, macOS, and Windows via the `rustls-corecrypto-provider` and `rustls-fips-shim` crates. Whether a given build is FIPS-*validated* depends on the platform and the provider's validation status — the framework provides the routing path, not the certificate. See the [FIPS probe example](https://github.com/constructorfabric/gears-rust/tree/main/examples/cf-gears-fips-probe).

## Supply-chain policy as code

Dependency risk is made reviewable rather than implicit:

- pinned toolchain (`rust-toolchain.toml`) and committed lockfiles;
- `cargo-deny` for licenses, bans, and advisories (with a separate FIPS deny policy);
- continuous fuzzing of parsers and validation surfaces;
- CI security scans.

## Auditability and isolation

- **Tenant isolation** is enforced at the query layer through `SecureConn` (see [Secure data path](../secure-data-path/)), which supports data-residency and isolation requirements.
- **Access trails / audit** — the authorization decisions and usage measurements provide the raw material for access trails and audit logs (the dedicated Audit gear is _planned_).

## What Gears gives you vs. what you still own

- **Gears provides**: FIPS-capable crypto routing, secure-by-default data access, tenant isolation, canonical errors, supply-chain controls, and the hooks for audit and usage.
- **You still own**: the actual certification (SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, GDPR processes), your organization's controls and evidence, and validating that your specific build and deployment meet the standard you claim.
