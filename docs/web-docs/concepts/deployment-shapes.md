One codebase compiles into three deployment shapes. What changes between them is configuration (`runtime.type`, backend selection, bootstrap entry point) — the gear code is identical.

| Shape | Where gears run | How they talk |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Single-node** | one process (edge, on-prem, dev) | in-process via `ClientHub` |
| **Multi-node** | across processes/machines, no orchestrator | gRPC, `SecurityContext` over headers |
| **Kubernetes** | containerized services | cluster DNS discovery, external gateways |

## Why one codebase can do this

The [SDK facade + backend pattern](../sdk-and-clienthub/) means a consumer resolves a trait and calls it without knowing whether the implementation is an in-process adapter or a gRPC client. Because that choice is configuration, the same logical composition of gears carries from a laptop to a cluster. This underpins the local-first workflow: compose and test gears together in one process, then deploy the same building blocks distributed.

## Status

Single-node and multi-node (gRPC out-of-process) are implemented. The cluster-plane coordination primitives that a large Kubernetes deployment relies on — distributed cache, leader election, distributed locks, service discovery — are **designed but not yet implemented**. See [Status and roadmap](../../capabilities/status-and-roadmap/) and the [cluster plane note](../runtime-and-lifecycle/).
